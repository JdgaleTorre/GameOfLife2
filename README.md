## Instructions

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. [-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.


## HowToPlay

Clone the repository and then open the `index.html`. The initial state you can draw any pattern on the grid, and then press the button Play to see how
the rules are been applying on the grid.

You can restart the grid, with the Reset Button. And if you don't want to draw a pattern, then you can use the option Random, to generate a Random pattern and play.
